# First Law of Thermodynamics Calculator

This Java application is designed to solve problems related to the First Law of Thermodynamics. It provides an interactive interface for users to input problem parameters and calculates unknown values based on user inputs.

<h3>🌍 Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Two Modes of Operation</b>: The program can handle problems where heat transfer does or does not occur.</li>
  <li><b>User-Friendly Input</b>: For each thermodynamic process, users input the values of heat transfer (Q), work done (W), and change in internal energy (ΔE). If any of these values are unknown, users can enter `999`, and the program will calculate the unknown value.</li>
 <li><b>Multiple Processes</b>: The program can handle problems involving multiple thermodynamic processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠️ Tech Stack:</h3>

<h3>🚀 Usage:</h3>

Upon running the program, users are presented with two options: `Calculate` or `Exit`. If `Calculate` is chosen, users specify whether heat transfer occurs or not. Depending on the choice, users are then prompted to input the relevant problem parameters. After all calculations are done, users are presented with the option to calculate another problem or exit the program.
